# ThunderFISH
Simple ImageJ script for sparse RNA-FISH data analysis with increased throughput. 

### What for?
ThunderFISH is a procedure developed for transcript counting in mouse embryonic stem cells for genes expressed at relatively low levels (<60mRNAs per cell). It allows imaging and analysis of up to 10,000 cells at high magnification a day.

### What does it do?
ThunderFISH is a pre-processing tool that extracts 2D single-cell RNA-FISH images from your 3D microscopy images of large field of view (e.g. 100um x 100um). Such images are compatible with diffraction-limited spot counting provided by ImageJ plugin ThunderSTORM.

### What will you find on this page?
Detailed Manual containing i) sample preparation protocol, ii) introduction to how to use the ThunderFISH ImageJ script on test data.

### Learn how to use ThunderFISH with test data
Download the test data and follow the instruction in the manual (.pdf file) to perform ThunderFISH analysis.
